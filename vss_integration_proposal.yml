#
# A proposal for how we can translate VSS signals to properties.
#
# Each branch is a namespace, and signals are defined as properties within those
# namespaces. As VSC considers all properties as readable and writeable there is no possibility to translate the VSS
# type (i.e. attribute, sensor or actuator) into Yaml. That does instead need to be managed by access rights in VSC
# implementations. No client shall e.g. have access right to write VIN, and even if they would the result would be
# the same - any attempt on writing should result in an error indicating "not supported"


# From VSS :
#
# - Vehicle:
#   type: branch
#   description: High-level vehicle data.
#
# - VehicleIdentification:
#   type: branch
#   description: Attributes that identify a vehicle
#
# - VehicleIdentification.VIN:
#   datatype: string
#   type: attribute
#   description: 17-character Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) as defined by ISO 3779


namespaces:
  - name: Vehicle
    description: High-level vehicle data.

    namespaces:
      - name: VehicleIdentification
        description:  Attributes that identify a vehicle

        properties:
          - name: VIN
            description: 17-character Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) as defined by ISO 3779
            datatype: string # VSS should have same native types as VSC
