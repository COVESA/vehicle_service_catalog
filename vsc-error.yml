        description: Operation succeeded. Definition of success is method dependent.
                     Depending on operation, it can either indicate that the request was accepted or that the
                     corresponding physical operation (e.g. FOTA update, seat movement) has succeeded.

        value: 2
        description: The operation has been initialized and is in progress.
                     May only be used by implementation framework and shall never be explicitly returned
                     by a service implementation.

# Do we see a need to differentiate between ok and completed
# Or shall we keep them but never specify both for an individual method, assuming that an individual method only can
# return once. 
#       - name: completed
#        value: 3
#        description: The operation has been completed
