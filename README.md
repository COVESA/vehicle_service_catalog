# VEHICLE SERVICE CATALOG (VSC)

The purpose of VSC is to share service/API descriptions for vehicles in a
standard catalog.   In parallel with this, the project has proposed to develop
a standardized service definition format that can easily be translated to and
from other formats such as FrancaIDL, protobuf, etc.  That format is now
developed under the name IFEX and may be continued to be used by the VSC project.

## Syntax definition

Please refer to [IFEX documentation](https://covesa.github.io/ifex).

## Tooling

Please refer to the [IFEX repository](https://github.com/COVESA/ifex) for information on available tooling.


## Participate and Contribute
The community has regular calls to discuss topics around VSC and IFEX. This includes specific tickets in this repository as well as the broader direction in which VSC is evolving.
You can find current call coordinates and dates in the [COVESA wiki](https://wiki.covesa.global/display/WIK4/COVESA+Common+Meeting+Schedule#).


### Contribute to VSC
