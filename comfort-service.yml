# Namespace
#
#  A namespace is a collection of datatypes, methods, properties,
#  events, and other namespaces.
#
#
# TODO:
# + Define error semantics for methods to align with FrancaIDL
#
# + Add array arguments.
#
# + How do we import namespaces, datatypes, etc from other service files?
#   Importing datatypes used by multiple services make sense, but it
#   will put a strain on the build pipeline since we now will have to
#   search for and assemble a library of interdependent services.

    # METHODS
    #
    # This section defines all methods for the given namespace.
    #
    # A method invokes a command for a given service that may optionally
    # return a value.

    # Only one service instance will execute a call. The service discovery
    # and invocation mechanism is up to the implementation to resolve (possibly
    # with the help of deployment files).
