# Namespace
#
#  A namespace is a collection of datatypes, methods, properties,
#  events, and other namespaces.
#
#
# TODO:
# + Define error semantics for methods to align with FrancaIDL
#
# + Add array arguments.
#
# + How do we import namespaces, datatypes, etc from other service files?
#   Importing datatypes used by multiple services make sense, but it
#   will put a strain on the build pipeline since we now will have to
#   search for and assemble a library of interdependent services.
